#Construction Data Demo
Repository with full ETL process and final Power BI Visualisation. This looks at US data relating to construction projects. There is a particular focus on project value and individual Client Agencies involved. 

This is sample data only and in no way a reflection of real world projects.

Repo Contents:
 - Design Folder contains all design aspects of the Dashboard (icons, colour pallette etc.)
 - raw_data.csv is the source data used for the Dashboard
 - etl_data.sql is the SQL script that creates a SQL Database to import the source table into a schema and creates views used in the Dashboard
 - Construction.pbix is the Power BI File containing the Dashboard
